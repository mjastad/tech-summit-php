(1) DEFECTS/FEATURES 
--------------------------  

BETA-0504.01  
- Feature: Added Task Management. 

(2) INTRODUCTION
-----------------
PRESTO v1 is an open-source `VM Managementâ€™ resource enabling users to manage NTNX VM elements through RESTful control (allows the flexible use of REST API commands, relative addressing, macros, libraries, and PHP runtime).

PRESTO v1 is a program inspired using an Object Oriented Design (OOD) approach which processes command line instructions that can be processed by PHP v5.x runtimes. 

PRESTO v1 will run on most platform(s) having a working PHP v5.x runtime. However, there may of course be minor differences regarding installation and usage between platforms.

PRESTO v1 has been tested using Mac OSX, 10.12.4 and BSD/Linux which the author is most familiar with. Feedback regarding installation and usage on other platforms will be greatly appreciated, and included in future distributions.


(3) HISTORY
-----------
PRESTO v1 is designed for Tech Summit 2017 as a guide for particiapnts to stand-up VM configurations on a Nutanix Cluster. PRESTO is implemented in PHP to (a) greatly improve its utility for both commandline and browser deployments, and (b) to make it available to the wide range of platforms which run PHP.
